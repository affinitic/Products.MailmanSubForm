0.5 (svn/unreleased):

- Add Plone 3.0 compatibility

- Make MailmanSubForm content type translatable (if LinguaPlone is installed)

- Add tools to re-generate translations (be carreful with python scripts and
  templates extensions, the 'make translations' command will parse them
  only if you rename them to .py and .pt)

- Add FR and DE translations files (to be filled in soon)

- Translate validator and form action python scripts with a message factory

- Use the translated object when sending confirmation mail

- Provide an optional captcha feature

0.4 (svn/unreleased):

- Merge message ids from submitted Dutch and Italian translation. This would have been
 easy if I'd done the i18n message ids from the start. Thanks to Davide Moro (IT) and
 atopia.nl (NL) (Sander van Geloven <sander@atopia.nl>) for working on both message ids
 and translations. My apologies for the damage done to both translations by the merge.

0.3:

- If subscriber names required, unsubscribes would not validate. Fixed. Thanks to Daniel J. Vreeman (djvreeman).

0.2:

- Fixed encoding issue that resulted in sending base64 requests that Mailman can't parse.

- Changed success prompts to match Mailman's newer (2.1.6) format.
