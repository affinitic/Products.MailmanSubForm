Version 0.3:

- If subscriber names required, unsubscribes would not validate. Fixed. Thanks to Daniel J. Vreeman (djvreeman).

Version 0.2:

- Fixed encoding issue that resulted in sending base64 requests that Mailman can't parse.

- Changed success prompts to match Mailman's newer (2.1.6) format.
