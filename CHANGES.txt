0.4 (svn/unreleased):

- Merge message ids from submitted Dutch and Italian translation. This would have been
 easy if I'd done the i18n message ids from the start. Thanks to Davide Moro (IT) and
 atopia.nl (NL) (Sander van Geloven <sander@atopia.nl>) for working on both message ids
 and translations. My apologies for the damage done to both translations by the merge.

0.3:

- If subscriber names required, unsubscribes would not validate. Fixed. Thanks to Daniel J. Vreeman (djvreeman).

0.2:

- Fixed encoding issue that resulted in sending base64 requests that Mailman can't parse.

- Changed success prompts to match Mailman's newer (2.1.6) format.
